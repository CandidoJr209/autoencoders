# autoencoders
## A collection of autoencoder examples

That repository uses some of the image datasets from the keras and the torchvision to build autoencoders. There are currently two example codes:

* MNIST_Autoencoder.ipynb
   * This one contains an architechture consisting only of dense layers reducing the number of features from 784 down to 64

* FMNIST_Conv_Autoencoder.ipynb
   * This one contains an architechture consisting of both convolutional and maxpooling layers reducing the number of features from 784 down to 64
